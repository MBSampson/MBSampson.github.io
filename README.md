# MS Personal Web Presence

This project is the primary place for interviewers and recruiters to see my skill-set in action.

The web page should:

1. Explain who I am (professional title and a tidbit about me)
2. Provide links to my: resume, email, phone number, Github account, and my LinkedIn
3. Showcase my past achievements and projects as well as my professional background
4. Be short, simple, and concise
5. Demonstrate my HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript skills

As time goes on and as I pick up more skills I will be adding and tweaking this page to accurately represent my skills as a developer.

Current TO-DO:

-Add "Upcoming Skills" to My Skill section (jQuery, Angular, and React)
